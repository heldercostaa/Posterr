## Development Setup

> **ESLint and Prettier**

This configuration is intended to be used with VSCode, other IDEs were not tested.

- Make sure to have the **[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)** extension installed and **not have** the **[Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)** installed, since the Prettier extensions might cause conflicts.
- Make sure to not have the `"editor.formatOnSave": true` configuration in your `settings.json` file.
- Make sure to restart VSCode after changing any of the above configurations.
